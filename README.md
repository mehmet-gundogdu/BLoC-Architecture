This Flutter e-commerce application demonstrates state management using the BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern to handle product listings and cart functionality. The app features two main screens: a ProductListScreen displaying available items and a CartScreen showing selected products, with all state changes managed through stream-based BLoCs. The architecture cleanly separates business logic (CartBloc, ProductBloc), data services (CartService, ProductService), and UI components while maintaining a reactive flow of data. Key features include adding/removing products from cart, real-time updates via StreamBuilders, and navigation between screens. The implementation uses Dart streams for state management without external packages, making it a lightweight yet powerful demonstration of core Flutter concepts including reactive programming, widget composition, and Material Design.
